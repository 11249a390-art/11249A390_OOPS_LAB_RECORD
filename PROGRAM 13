**13. Single inheritance (private and public)**

*Aim:*
Demonstrate single inheritance and the difference between public and private inheritance.

*Algorithm:*

1.Include <iostream>.
2.Define a Base class with public/protected/private members.
3.Define PublicDerived : public Base and PrivateDerived : private Base.
4.In derived classes, add methods that attempt to access base class members; note which access is permitted.
5.In main(), create objects and call methods to observe access behavior.
6.End program.

*Program:*

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Base {
public:
    int a = 10;
protected:
    int b = 20;
private:
    int c = 30;
};
class PublicDerived : public Base {
public:
    void show() { cout << "a = " << a << ", b = " << b << endl; }
};
class PrivateDerived : private Base {
public:
    void showp() { cout << "a = " << a << " (a is private here)" << endl; }
};
int main() {
    PublicDerived pd; pd.show();
    PrivateDerived pr; pr.showp();
    return 0;
}

*Output:*

a = 10, b = 20
a = 10 (a is private here)

*Result:*
Public inheritance retains base member access levels for users; private inheritance makes inherited public members private inside derived class. Protected still accessible to derived classes.
