**PROGRASM 10** : 10.a) Overloading the unary minus (-) operator

AIM

To demonstrate overloading the unary minus (-) operator in C++ using a member function.
The program negates the coordinates of a Point object using the overloaded unary minus operator.

✅ ALGORITHM

1.Start the program.

2,Define a class Point with:

   Private members x and y for coordinates.

   A constructor to initialize x and y (default values 0).

   A member function operator-() that returns a new Point object with x and y negated.

   A display() function to print the point’s coordinates.

3.In main():

    Create a Point object p1 with coordinates (10, -20).

    Use the overloaded unary minus operator to create p2 = -p1.

    Display both p1 and p2 using display().

4.End the program.



**SAMPLE OUTPUT** :

Original point p1: Point(10, -20)

Negated point p2: Point(-10, 20)

**FINAL RESULT** :

The program successfully demonstrates:

Overloading of the unary minus operator for a user-defined class.

Creation of a new object with negated coordinates.

Correct display of the original and negated points using a member function.

This illustrates operator overloading in C++ and shows
