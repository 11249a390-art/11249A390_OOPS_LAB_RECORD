**PROGRAM 5 : To demonstrate the use of constructor with its types and destructor**

**AIM** :

To demonstrate the use of default constructor, parameterized constructor, copy constructor, and destructor in a C++ class, and to show how these special member functions are invoked automatically
during object creation and destruction.

**ALGORITHM**

 1.Start the program.

2.Define a class MyClass containing:

    An integer data member value.

    A default constructor that sets value = 0 and prints a message.

    A parameterized constructor that sets value to a user-given value and prints a message.

    A copy constructor that copies the value from another object.

    A destructor that prints a message when an object is destroyed.

3.In the main() function:

   Create obj1 using the default constructor.

   Create obj2 using the parameterized constructor with value 10.

   Create obj3 as a copy of obj2, which calls the copy constructor.

4.End of main() function, where all objects go out of scope.

5.The destructor is called automatically for each object in reverse order of their creation.

6.End Program.


SOURCE CODE :

Demonstration (C++):
C++
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    int value;

    // Default Constructor
    MyClass() {
        value = 0;
        std::cout << "Default Constructor Called. Value: " << value << std::endl;
    }

    // Parameterized Constructor
    MyClass(int val) {
        value = val;
        std::cout << "Parameterized Constructor Called. Value: " << value << std::endl;
    }

    // Copy Constructor
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) {
        value = other.value;
        std::cout << "Copy Constructor Called. Value: " << value << std::endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        std::cout << "Destructor Called for object with value: " << value << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Calling Default Constructor
    MyClass obj1;

    // Calling Parameterized Constructor
    MyClass obj2(10);

    // Calling Copy Constructor
    MyClass obj3 = obj2; // or MyClass obj3(obj2);

    return 0; // Destructors will be called automatically when objects go out of scope
}
6. Illustrate the use of static data member and static member function
Static data members and static member functions in C++ provide a way to associate data and behavior with the class itself, rather than with individual objects of the class.
Static Data Member:
A static data member is a member variable that belongs to the class as a whole, not to any specific object. There is only one copy of a static data member for the entire class, shared by all objects. 
Use Case: Counting the number of objects created for a class.

Code: 

#include <iostream>

class Car {
public:
    static int carCount; // Static data member to count cars

    Car() {
        carCount++; // Increment count when a new car object is created
    }

    void displayCarInfo() {
        std::cout << "This is a car object." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Initialize static data member outside the class definition
int Car::carCount = 0;

int main() {
    Car car1;
    Car car2;
    Car car3;

    std::cout << "Total cars created: " << Car::carCount << std::endl; // Access using class name

    return 0;
}

** SAMPLE OUTPUT** :

(Actual output may vary slightly depending on compiler)

Default Constructor Called. Value: 0

Parameterized Constructor Called. Value: 10

Copy Constructor Called. Value: 10

Destructor Called for object with value: 10

Destructor Called for object with value: 10

Destructor Called for object with value: 0


** FINAL RESULT ** :
The program successfully demonstrates:


How constructors initialize objects automatically.


How the copy constructor is invoked when a new object is created from an existing object.


How the destructor is executed when objects go out of scope.


Order of destruction is reverse of construction.


This helps in understanding the lifecycle of objects in C++ and the role of special member functions.
