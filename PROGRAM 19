**19. To implement runtime polymorphism using virtual functions**

*Aim:*
Show runtime polymorphism where base pointer calls derived class methods using virtual functions.

*Algorithm:*

1.Include <iostream>.
2.Create base class Base with virtual show() method.
3.Derive Derived and override show().
4.In main(), create Base* pointer to Derived object and call show() to demonstrate polymorphism.
5.End program.

*Program:*

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show(){ cout << "Base\n"; }
    virtual ~Base() {}
};
class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { cout << "Derived\n"; }
};
int main() {
    Base* p = new Derived();
    p->show();
    delete p;
    return 0;
}

*Output:*

Data from file : Hello, this is a file handling example.

*Result:*
Virtual functions enable correct derived class methods to be called through base class pointers at runtime.
