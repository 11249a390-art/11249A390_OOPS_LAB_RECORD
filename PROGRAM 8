** PROGRAM 8 : 8.a) Allocating and deallocating a single variable

**AIM**:
To demonstrate dynamic memory allocation in C++ using new and delete by allocating memory for an integer, accessing its value, and properly deallocating the memory to avoid memory leaks.
     
**ALGORITHM ** :

1.Start the program.

2.Dynamically allocate memory for an integer using new and initialize it to 10.

3.Store the address of the allocated memory in a pointer variable ptr_int.

4.Dereference the pointer using *ptr_int to access and print the stored value.

5.Deallocate the previously allocated memory using delete.

6.Set the pointer to nullptr to avoid a dangling pointer.

7.End the program.

**SOURCE CODE ** :
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Dynamically allocate memory for an integer and initialize it to 10
    int* ptr_int = new int(10);

    // Print the value stored at the allocated address
    std::cout << "Value of dynamically allocated integer: " << *ptr_int << std::endl;

    // Deallocate the memory to prevent a memory leak
    delete ptr_int;
    ptr_int = nullptr; // Set the pointer to nullptr after deletion (best practice)

    return 0;
}

**SAMPLE OUTPUT** :

Value of dynamically allocated integer: 10


**FINAL RESULT** :

1.The program successfully demonstrates how to:

    Dynamically allocate memory for an integer on the heap using new.

    Access the stored value using dereferencing.

    Properly free the allocated memory using delete.

    Prevent dangling pointers by setting the pointer to nullptr.

2.This ensures efficient memory management and prevents memory leaks in C++.
