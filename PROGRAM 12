**12. Assignment and comparison of two strings (binary operator overloading)**

*Aim:*
Demonstrate assignment and comparison (equality) of strings (using std::string).

*Algorithm:*

1.Include <iostream> and <string>.
2.Use std::string which provides assignment and equality == by default.
3.Create sample strings, assign one to another, and compare using ==.
4.Print comparison results.
5.End program.

*Program:*

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    string s1 = "Hello";
    string s2 = "World";
    string s3 = s1; // assignment
    cout << (s1 == s3 ? "s1 equals s3" : "s1 not equal s3") << endl;
    cout << (s1 == s2 ? "s1 equals s2" : "s1 not equal s2") << endl;
    return 0;
}

*Output:*

s1 equals s3
s1 not equal s2

*Result:*
Standard std::string supports assignment and equality comparison directly. Results show correct behavior for assignment and comparison.
