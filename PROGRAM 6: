**PROGRAM 6** :  Illustrate the use of static data member and static member function

**AIM** :
To write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of a static data member inside a class.
The program counts how many objects of the Car class are created using a static variable that is shared among all objects.

**ALGORITHM** :

1.Start the program.

2.Define a class Car:

    Declare a static integer data member carCount to store the total number of Car objects created.

    Create a constructor that increments carCount each time a new object is created.

    Define a member function displayCarInfo() to display basic information.

3.Define and initialize the static member outside the class:

    int Car::carCount = 0;

4.In the main() function:

    Create three objects: car1, car2, and car3.

    Print the total number of cars created using the class name:

     Car::carCount

5.End the program.


***SOURCE CODE** :
Code: 


#include <iostream>

class Car {
public:
    static int carCount; // Static data member to count cars

    Car() {
        carCount++; // Increment count when a new car object is created
    }

    void displayCarInfo() {
        std::cout << "This is a car object." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Initialize static data member outside the class definition
int Car::carCount = 0;

int main() {
    Car car1;
    Car car2;
    Car car3;

    std::cout << "Total cars created: " << Car::carCount << std::endl; // Access using class name

    return 0;
}


**SAMPLE OUTPUT ** :

Total cars created: 3

**FINAL RESULT** :

The program successfully demonstrates:

      How static data members are shared across all objects of a class.

      How the constructor can be used to automatically update a static counter whenever a new object is created.

      That the total count of objects can be accessed using the class name (Car::carCount).

Thus, the program correctly counts and displays the number of car objects created.
