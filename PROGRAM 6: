**PROGRSM 6: Illustrate the use of array of objects **

**AIM** :
To write a C++ program that demonstrates how to declare, initialize, and access an array of objects using a Student class.
The program stores the details (name and roll number) of multiple students and displays them.

**ALGORITHM** :

1.Start the program.

2.Define a class Student with:

     Data members: name (string), rollNumber (int)

     A member function displayInfo() to print student details.

3.In the main() function:

   Declare an array of 3 Student objects:
Student students[3];

   Initialize each object:

      Assign name and roll number to students[0]

     Assign name and roll number to students[1]

     Assign name and roll number to students[2]

4.Use a for loop to iterate through the array and call displayInfo() for each student.

5.End the program.

**SOURCE CODE** :

C++
    #include <iostream>
    #include <string>

    class Student {
    public:
        std::string name;
        int rollNumber;

        void displayInfo() {
            std::cout << "Name: " << name << ", Roll No: " << rollNumber << std::endl;
        }
    };

    int main() {
        Student students[3]; // Declaring an array of 3 Student objects

        // Initializing and accessing objects in the array
        students[0].name = "Alice";
        students[0].rollNumber = 101;

        students[1].name = "Bob";
        students[1].rollNumber = 102;

        students[2].name = "Charlie";
        students[2].rollNumber = 103;

        // Displaying information for all students
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
            students[i].displayInfo();
        }

        return 0;
    }


**SAMPLE OUTPUT** :

When you run the program, the output will be:

Name: Alice, Roll No: 101
Name: Bob, Roll No: 102
Name: Charlie, Roll No: 103


**FINAL RESULT** :

The program successfully demonstrates how:

A class can be used to model a student.

An array of objects can store multiple instances of a class.

Each object in the array can be accessed and manipulated individually.

The displayInfo() function prints the stored data of all students.

This helps understand object arrays and class usage in C++.
