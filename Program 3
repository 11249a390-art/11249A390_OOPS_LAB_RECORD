PROGRAM 3 : Implement passing object as function arguments and return object from function

AIM: To demonstrate how to pass objects as function arguments (by value and by reference) and return objects from functions in C++.

ALGORITHM :

1.Start the program.

2.Create a class MyClass with a data member value.

3.Define a constructor to initialize the object with a given value.

4.Write a function modifyObject() that takes a MyClass object by value and modifies it — this will not affect the original object.

5.Write another function modifyAndReturn() that takes a MyClass object, modifies it, and returns a new object.

6.In the main() function:

-Create an object originalObj.

-Pass it to modifyObject() (changes won’t affect the original).

-Pass it to modifyAndReturn() and get a new modified object as return.

-Display the results.

7.End the program.

PROGRAM #include

class MyClass {
public:
    int value;
    MyClass(int v) : value(v) {}
    };

void modifyObject(MyClass obj) { // obj is a copy
    obj.value = 100;
}

int main() {
    MyClass originalObj(10);
    std::cout << "Original value before: " << originalObj.value << std::endl;
    modifyObject(originalObj);
    std::cout << "Original value after: " << originalObj.value << std::endl; // Still 10
    return 0;
}
SAMPLE OUTPUT : Original value before modifyObject(): 10 Inside modifyObject(): value changed to 100 Original value after modifyObject(): 10 Original value after modifyAndReturn(): 10 New object value (returned): 200

FINAL RESULT The program demonstrates two important concepts:

1.Passing object as a function argument (by value):

-When an object is passed by value, a copy of the object is made.

-Changes inside the function do not affect the original object.

2.Returning object from a function:

-A function can return an object.

-The returned object can contain modified data that is independent of the original.

Thus, the aim of implementing passing object as function argument and returning object from function is successfully achieved.
