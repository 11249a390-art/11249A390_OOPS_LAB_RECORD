**14. Multiple inheritance**

*Aim:*

Demonstrate a class inheriting from two base classes.


*Algorithm:*


1.Include <iostream>.

2.Define two base classes (A, B) with their own members.

3.Define Derived : public A, public B that can access members from both bases.

4.In main(), create a Derived object and call a method that uses both base class members.

5.End program.


*Program:*


#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class A { public: void showA(){ cout << "A\n"; } };

class B { public: void showB(){ cout << "B\n"; } };

class Derived : public A, public B {

public:

    void showBoth(){ showA(); showB(); }

};

int main() {

    Derived d;

    d.showBoth();

    return 0;

}

*Output:*


A

B

C

*Result:*

Multiple inheritance lets a derived class access features of more than one base class. Use with care to avoid ambiguity.
