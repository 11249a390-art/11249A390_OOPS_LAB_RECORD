PROGRAM 1 : Illustrate class & objects. Implement member function defined inside and outside the class.

*AIM :To illustrate the concept of Class and Objects in C++ and demonstrate how to implement member functions defined both inside and outside the class.

ALGORITHM 1.Start the program.

2.Define a class named Car.

3.Declare data members: brand, model, and year.

-Define one member function (displayInfo()) inside the class to display car details.

-Declare another member function (startEngine()) to be defined outside the class.

-Define the function startEngine() outside the class using the scope resolution operator ::.
4.In the main() function:

-Create two objects: myCar and anotherCar.

-Assign values to myCar's data members.

-Call the member functions displayInfo() and startEngine() for myCar.
5.End the program.

SOURCE CODE : #include #include

// Define a class named 'Car' class Car { public: // Data members (attributes) std::string brand; std::string model; int year;

// Member function defined inside the class
void displayInfo() {
    std::cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Model: " << model << ", Year: " << year << std::endl;
}

// Member function declared inside, defined outside
void startEngine(); 
};

// Member function defined outside the class using the scope resolution operator (::) void Car::startEngine() { std::cout << "The " << brand << " " << model << " engine is starting..." << std::endl; }

int main() { // Create objects of the 'Car' class Car myCar; // Object 1 Car anotherCar; // Object 2

// Assign values to data members of myCar
myCar.brand = "Toyota";
myCar.model = "Camry";
myCar.year = 2023;

 // Assign values to data members of anotherCar
anotherCar.brand = "Honda";
anotherCar.model = "Civic";
anotherCar.year = 2022;

// Call member functions for each object
myCar.displayInfo();
myCar.startEngine();

anotherCar.displayInfo();
  anotherCar.startEngine();

return 0;
}

SAMPLE OUTPUT : Brand: Toyota, Model: Camry, Year: 2023 The Toyota Camry engine is starting...

FINAL RESULT : The program successfully demonstrates: -The concept of classes and objects in C++. -How member functions can be defined inside and outside a class. -How to create objects, assign values, and invoke class functions. Thus, the objective of illustrating Class and Objects with member function implementation has been achieved successfully .
